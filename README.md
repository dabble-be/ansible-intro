In this introduction into Configuration Management using Ansible, we'll discover the advantages of automating machine provisioning using Ansible's built-in abstractions. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate a few operations using Ansible's built-in DSL ([Domain-Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)).
We'll be providing a virtual environment with a custom NginX greeting page; Provisioned using Ansible.
